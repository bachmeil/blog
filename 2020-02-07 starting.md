# My New Blog

Starting a new blog. I've blogged before, but there wasn't much reason for anyone to read it, so it didn't last long. Commenting on current events is not my cup of tea.

I'm using a [static site generator called jenny](https://github.com/bachmeil/jenny). I was surprised to see a website generator written in Bash. When I looked at it, I found an impressive piece of software engineering. It's minimalistic yet has the features I want, easy to modify/extend, has more or less no overhead, and because it's written in Bash, it's as rock solid as any software you'll ever use.

Pages are published to a Github repo, which serves the site. Extrapolating from my past failed attempts at blogging, I won't be posting very much. This is mostly about learning to do new things.
