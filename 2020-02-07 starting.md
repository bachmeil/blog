# My New Blog

Starting a new blog. I've blogged before, but there wasn't much reason for anyone to read it, and it didn't last long. Commenting on current events is not my cup of tea.

I'm using a [static site generator called jenny](https://github.com/bachmeil/jenny). I was surprised to see a website generator written in Bash. When I looked at it, I realized it was complete yet minimalistic, low overhead, very well thought out, and because it's written in Bash, as rock solid as any software you'll find.

Pages are published to a Github repo, which then serves the site. I don't expect to post very much based on my past attempts at maintaining websites and blogging. This is mostly about learning to do new things.
